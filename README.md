# RU Living (around campus?)
 
RU Living is a student-focused web application developed during HackRU Fall 2023 to assist students in determining the ideal living location at Rutgers University. Students complete a quick assessment to determine their interests in terms of academicsÂ and lifestyle. The four Rutgers campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook/Douglass) that best fit the student's profile are suggested by RU Living based on assessment findings. Additionally, it makes recommendations for particular housing possibilities on the selected campus and students can search for compatible roommates based on shared interests, habits, or academic pursuits. This feature encourages a sense of community and compatibility among roommates. RU Living provides a comprehensive solution for students to make decisions that are in line with their academic and lifestyle interests by combining insights into both campus and housing options. This initiative simplifies the decision-making process, boosting the overall Rutgers University experience and fostering the success and happiness of students while they are enrolled at the institution.
