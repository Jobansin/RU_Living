# RU Living (around campus?)
 
RU Living is a student-focused web application developed during HackRU Fall 2023 to assist students in determining the ideal campus at Rutgers University that best suits their preferences and needs. By making it easier to choose between the university's four main campuses—Busch, Livingston, College Avenue, and Cook/Douglass—this creative concept streamlines a difficult decision-making process.
